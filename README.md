## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing stock market data using VBA scripting. The task includes calculating quarterly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volumes for each stock, as well as identifying stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Background
I applyed VBA scripting to financial data analysis to automate repetitive tasks and performing calculations on large datasets so I can gain valuable insights into stock market trends and performance metrics.

## Tools and Libraries Used
Excel for data manipulation and analysis
VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for scripting and automation

## Process Description
Data Retrieval: Develop a VBA script to loop through each quarter of stock data and retrieve relevant information such as ticker symbols, stock volumes, open prices, and close prices.

Column Creation: Create new columns on the worksheet to store the retrieved data, including ticker symbols, total stock volumes, quarterly changes, and percentage changes.

Conditional Formatting: Apply conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red, enhancing the visual representation of data.

Calculated Values: Calculate the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume for each quarter and display these values in the output.

Looping Across Worksheets: Modify the VBA script to run on all sheets (quarters) simultaneously, ensuring consistent performance across multiple datasets.

## Conclusion
By leveraging VBA scripting and Excel functionality, I performed a comprehensive analysis of stock market data. Through automation and visualization techniques, I identified valuable insights into stock performance metrics and identify key trends for further exploration.
